A browser plugin that provides encrypted communication across any web platform.  We support aes and ecc.

How to Use
==========

1. To encrypt text simply type in a text box and press ctrl/cmd+e to encrypt the text. In certain textboxes if your text is too long, the encrypted text (ciphertext) may be copied to your clipboard, in which case you must paste it in the textbox.
2. To type in a JavaScript-protected textbox, press ctrl/cmd+alt+e. Once again to encrypt that text press ctrl/cmd+e and the ciphertex will be copied to your clipboard.
3. To add a new key press the lock icon in the browser toolbar and enter/generate your new key and description. To toggle which key is active simply click on the key (shift-click for multiple keys) (note that you may have to refresh the page to see some decryption using that key).
4. Encrypt stuff!
